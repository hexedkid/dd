For low-light applications, it is possible to increase the ADC integration time. Normally, the integration time is
25.6 µs. By increasing this integration time to 410 µs, the ADC can detect light levels as low as 1 lx. The ADC can
be programmed with an integration time as high as 3.28 ms, allowing measurement to 100 mlx light levels. The
ADC integration time for the Visible Light Ambient measurement can be programmed independently of the ADC
integration time of the Infrared Light Ambient measurement. The independent ADC parameters allow operation
under glass covers having a higher transmittance to Infrared Light than Visible Light.
